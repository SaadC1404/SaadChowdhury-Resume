        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business Administrationüìö</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello! Welcome to my resume profile! I am a first-year Business Administration Major planning to concentrate in accounting at the University of California, Riverside. I am currently seeking professional business opportunities, specifically in accounting.I love meeting and speaking to new people, so feel free to reach out to me at saadchowdhury1404@gmail.com. Recent information has surfaced about Rocco Perri potentially having ties to the murder of Domenic Scaroni which took place last night. Domenic was in the Niagara area last night to meet with other organized crime figures. That‚Äôs when the murder took place. Domenic Scaroni took three bullets to the head which lead him to death. Domenic Scaroni along with his brother, Joseph Scaroni, were two gang bosses a part of the Calabrian bootlegging operation in Hamilton, Ontario. Rocco Perri, the self-proclaimed ‚ÄúKing of Bootleggers‚Äù is a rival bootlegger of the Scaroni Brothers. Rocco Perri is suspected to have possibly organized the murder of Domenic‚Äôs death. The death would benefit him greatly as Rocco would be left in control of Domenic‚Äôs territory and ultimately expand his bootlegging empire.If Rocco truly is responsible for the murder of Domenic Scaroni, he still has obstacles in his way. The major obstacle before Rocco can truly gain full control of the Calabrian bootlegging operation is Domenic‚Äôs brother, Joseph Scaroni. Joseph and Domenic ran the Calabrian bootlegging operation together as gang bosses. Joseph Scaroni says ‚Äú I will attempt to take over the operation and Domenic‚Äôs share in order for the family‚Äôs legacy to continue.‚Äù.    
     This leads us to ponder, what will ‚ÄúThe King of Bootleggers‚Äù next move be? The hooch smuggling operation is certainly getting out of hand and all this raz-ma-taz of violence is certainly a bunch of banana oil. This blunder surely must be stopped immediately and the money of tax-paying citizens should no longer be wasted on stopping bootleggers.Fortunately, for law-abiding citizens, gin mills are slowly being uncovered and shut down. Undercover agents working for the police have uncovered Rocco Perri‚Äôs gin mill operation and procedures are being taken in order to shut them down and ultimately, the whole operation. With all these murders occurring and chaos running wild all through Canada, it leads us to question whether the prohibition is for the better or worse of citizens. Is the ban of alcoholic beverages worth the number of lives being taken in bootlegging operations or is it all just banana Thank you for your kind words, they truly mean a lot. I also would like to thank you for all that you have done throughout the quarter. Doing well on the final exam would not have been possible without an instructor such as yourself, who has gone above and beyond in every aspect of teaching. Your course has improved my reading and writing abilities while also helping boost my confidence in my writing. I have had a very positive experience with you and hope to be taught by you again. I am very grateful to you, and once again, thank you for everything. Take care and good luck!

        Thank<br><br>

        You
